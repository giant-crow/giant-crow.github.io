<h1><strong><em>Inspirations</em></strong></h1>
<p>Chainsaw Man, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Annihilation / Borne (&amp; other works of Jeff VanderMeer), SCP Foundation / Control, Blades in the Dark</p>
<h1><strong><em>Key ideas</em></strong></h1>
<h2><strong>The Blight</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>haze of otherworldly spores / mutagenic plague that infects plants, animals and humans and turns &lsquo;em Weird</li>
<li>(apparently) desires only to consume the human world; as far as we know, has already reclaimed everything outside of a handful of bubble cities</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>The City</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>bubble city bubble city! we love a walled garden</li>
<li>modern&nbsp;but not 'realistic' / 5 mins into the future; Andean / Art Deco / 90s anime fusion</li>
<li>a surface utopia where menial jobs are replaced by robots / day-to-day AI integration</li>
<li>BUT a lot of Weird and Mysterious shit (illegal and government-sanctioned) going on under the surface to keep it ticking over</li>
<li>likes to think it is pristine and sterile; the blight *is* very much already inside, but is mostly spoken of in whispers</li>
<li>most people within the city who contract the blight simply die; others are "disappeared" through the green door</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>The PCs work in The Warren / Facility 323</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Go through the green door in the Wellbeing Hub and take the elevator down into the earth. The many basement floors of the Hub are taken up by a large medical facility housing blighted test subjects and their dedicated research teams. Much bigger underground than it is aboveground, and goes so deep it breaches a huge natural cavern with links to the local tunnels and cave system. This is not the organisation's main HQ, but it is one of their oldest and most well-appointed facilities. </p>
<p>Think the <a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/evangelion/images/3/33/GeoFront_Nerv_HQ_Eva_Chronicle.png/revision/latest?cb=20230815223912">Geofront/NERV HQ</a>; <a href="https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Oldest_House#Gallery">The Oldest House</a>; nuclear facilities and submarines from the 60s through 90s. Brutalist atria and tight, claustrophobic hallways; harsh lighting and sharp corners; stairs and ladders and stairs and elevators; all rooms lock from the outside.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mutation in response to the blight is what makes a "magical girl": test subjects in an experimental city defence programme. There's a Lot going on here that is mysterious and undefined.</p>
<p>Key theme of the game is all about the PCs' complicated feelings around this push and pull between the city and the blight (and what each represents), about the changes to their body and role in society; what they have lost and what they have gained.</p>
<h2><strong>What is a magical girl?</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>a person who contracted the blight, survived and was lucky enough to mutate into something "useful"</li>
<li>doesn't need to be a girl (although I'd prefer no cis men, as ideally I like them to have SOME kind of connection to femaleness, positive or negative)</li>
<li>does need to be an adult (because I said so)</li>
</ul>
<h1><strong><em>What do I need?</em></strong></h1>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&ldquo;SERIES RULE: HUNTERS IN THE NIGHT</strong></p>
<p>The protagonists are not the only ones hunting, there is a rival pack of hunters that is established during series creation. These hunters are another threat to be reckoned with, and include former friends or allies of the protagonists. It is not simply competition&mdash;it is a personal and spiteful rivalry, a hard fought contest for meager resources.</p>
<p>The protagonists will need to fend off these other hunters in order to secure their hunting grounds. If left unchecked, these rival hunters will cause trouble for the protagonists by interfering with their other missions, and stealing their prey.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>4 magical girls who work in a team and have a reason to conflict with the PCs</strong></p>
<p>I think there's two distinct ways we could go with this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>a rival group working for the same organisation and seeking to one-up the PCs. we have a couple of backstory NPCs that would slot right into this kind of group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an "underground" group - four people who somehow escaped the notice of the authorities and developed their mutations in secret. obvious reasons to be opposed to the PCs. I kind of like this idea especially as it has potential for these four characters to see<em> themselves</em> as the 'heroes' - but it would mean starting from scratch most likely!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>but I am extremely open to all ideas!! :D I don't really care all that much about realism. rule of cool totally valid here.</p>
<p><strong>Please do not say anything weird or mean about my players/their characters/etc.</strong> Like I doubt I have to say this but yeah.</p>
<p>If you have any questions pls lmk!</p>

<h1><strong><em>PCs</em></strong></h1>
<h2><strong>Belle (she/her)</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Belle's birth was part of the B-L project, led by Professor Eigengrau, which aimed to discover what children of blighted parents might look like/be capable of.</li>
<li>Her mother was heavily blighted while pregnant, and she was born having already contract the blight <em>in utero</em>.</li>
<li>She was raised in The Warren by its personnel and attended Our Lady school for 14 years. The other students of the school did not know she was a "special case" - just thought she was a bit odd.</li>
<li>Had only one friend, Holly, who in truth was part of the B-L experiment and helped to develop her social skills. Doesn't see Holly much any more since she switched departments.</li>
<li>Has dabbled in many hobbies over the years, but has no particular skill or interest in any one of them.</li>
<li>Belle is not the only living subject remaining from the B-L Project; she has a "sister", or maybe more than one.</li>
<li>She is often more openly followed around by handlers and aides than the other girls. Her time is carefully managed to avoid run-ins with her sister(s).</li>
<li>Belle's transcendent form spreads blight wherever she goes, but as "the new normal" - strange flowers/mist sprouting from her etc. Her true self is the first of a new breed - homo novus - something that is made to live in the new world.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h2><strong>Cilla (she/her)</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Late 20s. Works in the Emerald Wellbeing Hub as a receptionist on nightshifts now and then, as her "normal" life cover.</li>
<li>Cilla used to be a rat for the Rat Queen in her teens, alongside Melina, and hung out a lot in the Den.</li>
<li>Has worked in the Warren since she was 16 (when she and Melina were originally blighted). Melina "gave in" to the blight and fled the city to be one with it, and Cilla is hurt to this day. She wants to believe Melina is still out there somewhere.</li>
<li>"Cookie-cutter" life: mother, father, 4 siblings in total. She was put under a lot of pressure to be perfect as a child and still struggles with the fallout of failing to live up to it.</li>
<li>The youngest of her siblings is Koby, who looks up to her despite her low status in the family. She stays abreast of what's cool with the kids via his chatter.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>[no pic of this one I'm sorry]</em></p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Juno (she/her)</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Juno used to work at the Warren as a scientist studying the blight, but was exposed and contracted the blight when her hazmat suit failed.</li>
<li>She tried to keep this a secret as she believed she was strong enough to resist the effects, but was ratted out by Ceres and forcibly switched from researcher to research subject.</li>
<li>Does not have long left to live, and is determined to make something of however much time remains. Coughs a lot and is generally sickly.</li>
<li>She joined the magical girl project at the same time as Diana, and considers her a rival. Diana does not feel the same way.</li>
<li>Juno's respiratory system becomes toxic when she transcends, and she breathes out blighted air, which is representative of her unhealthy relationship with herself/others/her own body.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h2><strong>Riley (he/they) &amp; Ash (they/them)</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Riley was a typical teen rebel hanging out in the Den and at the Artfight Arena. Little else is known about his background.</li>
<li>He was exposed to an unusual form of blight which caused a sentient parasite, Ash, to develop inside his body. They now share the body, with each in control at different times.</li>
<li>Riley has not yet managed to tap into a transcendent blighted form and they feel inferior to the rest of the team because of this.</li>
<li>Both Riley and Ash are attached to Dr Corbyn, who was heavily involved in the symbiont project and has always shown them both kindness.</li>
<li>Around the time Riley was brought to the Warren for study they met Vanta, a fellow host to a symbiont, and they became fast friends. Vanta achieved final fusion with her symbiont easily and quickly, and Riley feels betrayed/abandoned by the friend they lost.</li>
<li>Riley's transcendent self is an expression of his repressed feelings/perceptions about himself and Ash's deep desire to be beautiful and pristine / not feel profane in their very existence.</li>
</ul>
