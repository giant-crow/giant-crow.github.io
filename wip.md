She’s not sure she believes in god… or karma. The idea of a universal consciousness. Whatever. She’s actually not even sure if any of those concepts would describe what she’s noticed. She’s not a *nerd*, okay? It’s just that, sometimes, it feels like the game is watching them play - learning about them, then shaping things around what it learns.

Take this, for example: it’s got that she doesn’t have to explain her situation to the rest of them any more, because they’re always just below her own current level of understanding. Maybe their sprites are lecturing them about Time players now, or telling them *something*, at least. She prefers this. It was getting pretty old trotting out the same reasoning time after time, sitting through the expressions of disbelief, listening to yet more strangers wearing the faces of her old friends argue about an experience that was not their own - that they had no *right* to debate, in front of her or otherwise. Of course, now she has to suffer their sympathetic looks and gently prodding questions. Everyone’s a detective, trying to satisfy their own curiosity in the guise of *honestly trying to help*. But she’s tougher now: she doesn’t tear up any more, when she thinks about it.

And if - *when* - it gets to be too much, she can always just go. Slip sideways out of this body and escape once more into the space between timelines, quietly sacrifice an alternate universe for another roll of the dice. There is always that option.

*If someone* is *watching*, she thinks, *I must be their favourite.*

“I think I wasn’t tough enough,” you say. Albiri baits her hook: her hands are rock steady, in spite of her constant chill. There’s a long pause as she surveys the still water, scanning for the telltale shimmer of scales. She narrows her eyes - takes aim - and casts her line. You never saw anything at all.

“Sure. Me n-neither,” she replies, settling down beside you on the prow of the ship.

“Yeah, well. You know what I mean.” You frown, and pick at a small hole in your leggings. “I’m being shuffled through dozens of different bodies, the game’s trying to toughen me up. Desensitise me or something. Put something in me that I’m lacking, something I’m going to need to finally win. Like... Why? What is it?”

You glance over and she’s staring right back at you, arching an eyebrow. Suddenly - intensely -you’re ashamed of yourself. “Sorry.” But she just smiles, in a vague, disappointed way. It makes you feel sick. She doesn’t look like herself at all.

“Save it. I'm sure there's s-someone else who needs it more.”

Players have died, and both of you know this means you’ll be moving on soon; she’ll be left here with whatever remains when you vacate a body, to wait out her own eventual death. It won’t come quickly, you know. You’ve met a lot of her in the past weeks and months, and none of them have been quitters. No Albiri you know would just lie down and let it end. She’ll catch fish, and try to make it easier on the survivors, and she’ll rally them to figure something out together that will make the rest of their lives, however short, seem not quite so pointless.

You wonder if this is what she wants, or just what she feels is her duty.

--

“Have you thought about what might happen if I didn’t go, sometime?” you ask, making a big deal out of staring at your nails. *This time*, you mean.

“No,” she says, too casually. You know she knows what you’re implying, but you have to say it. She deserves to know the way you really think.

“... we could win,” you mutter, “if we were willing to accept a few losses. I know I could do it now. Nobody said it has to be an *unconditional* victory.” Privately, you’re beginning to think that might not even be possible.

Albiri chews this over a while, watching the horizon instead of watching you. Her expression doesn’t give anything away.

“Probably,” she concedes, “but then, whatever comes after, would you be able to live with that decision?”

--

You didn’t get on with her when you met, and in some timelines it seems the two of you never found reason to repair those botched first impressions. She treats you with icy courtesy (or as close as she ever comes) and that’s all. In others she's still bright and hard, too stuck on someone who no longer loves her to see someone who *does* standing right in front of her. Albiris of this variety make a good show at nonchalance, but you know her tells and you know she's tired of pretending. You want to shake her, hard. *The shipping wall never lies!*

In this universe, he was dead before they ever entered the session. You like these universes. Theirs are usually the happiest Albiris.

You want to go back and shake *yourself*, for everything you could have prevented.

It’s time to go before you’re ready, and for the billionth time you curse your shitty class and its shitty fucking abilities. Your kingdom for the power to make a moment last, to multiply it, stretch it out into another moment, and another, and another…

But you’ve already said your goodbyes, short and clean, the way she likes it. You tell yourself you prefer it this way too. Now she’s in position to catch you when your body collapses to the deck, waiting. You’re putting your thoughts in order and trying to centre yourself for an imminent jump when suddenly, she grabs hold of your arm. You’re startled into nearly snapping at her, but something in her eyes wavers - and it gives you pause. 

Albiri pulls sharply and quite literally envelops you in a hug, her enormous height bearing down on you. She murmurs *g'nna miss you* into your hair, and it's only a little grudging. She smells like wood and her arms are so solid. Something to cling to; an anchoring point. God*damn*it.

You hug her back. “I’ll tell Nav you said hi.”

It was hard to go before. It's so much more difficult now. But you close your eyes and remember pain - cold steel slipping under your ribs like ice water crashing down on you, how it felt when the meat of your lungs parted around the blade, and - 

You manage it.

Did you feel her smile just there, at the end? You still wonder. You’ll never know. Just another secret for someone to take to the grave on you.

There are universes where Charta didn't make it; there are universes where he lives. While his weird little moirail is a fixture - immutable, you'll say, until proven otherwise - it seems his own survival is a variable. You wonder at that. Does it mean Charta was never 'meant' to play Sgrub? That his death, howsoever you feel, is no special reason to abandon a timeline? 

Lately you've been trying out this new thing where you ignore your emotions and take things from a purely logical point of view.

But that same logic would haemorrhage most of the team, you reason. Hardly anyone shows up in every single timeline, and if they're the only *true* players, then what would be the damn point of even having twelve to begin with?

You grit your teeth with frustration.

(One you can describe only as 'inescapable' - but you aren't ready to even think that name again. Not yet.)

Charta looks up, his maps abruptly forgotten, his forehead crinkling until his brows almost meet in the middle. "Is something wrong?"

--

For no reason at all, you think of... six timelines ago? That's right. You've long since stopped tracking time linearly, but your skill identifying which memory comes from which alternate universe continues to improve. You're standing on a beach, on his planet. The sun is just setting, washing the whole scene pink. Your breath comes shallow but you won't allow yourself to gasp. Nothing that would sound so much like a sob.

Charta lies bleeding in the foam. The tide washes a bloom of tyrian out to sea, one wave at a time, until you can't tell what's blood and what's water. The light is quickly going from his eyes, you can feel it. Or... no. What you can *feel* is his time, quite literally, running out; the last grains of sand slipping through the waist of his hourglass.

He's not long for this life. It's no surprise. You'd bet everything you care for on who did this.

"Celuta?" He sounds confused, blinking like he can’t believe his eyes. Does he know what's happened? Does he know what's yet to come? He can't possibly. Charta is no Prince, after all, nor a Knight in shining armour; he’s nothing like the heroes from his stories, as you were always fond of reminding him. If he knew the end was near, he wouldn't go with any dignity, you’re sure. If he knew.

You stand over him wordlessly. It's useless to move him now, pointless to struggle. You may as well let him die in the water, as seadwellers ought. The salt air is stinging your eyes, and that’s the only reason why, when you swipe at them with the back of your hand, it comes away damp. 

You’re disgusted with yourself.

"Celuta... Is something wrong?"

--

He bleeds out. You don’t kiss him. It’s a mercy - not that he would have understood.

You don’t don’t *don’t* care.

--

"No," you say, finally, and it's only been seconds since he asked but for you they were hours. **"Nothing. Forget it."**

His puzzled frown lingers on you for some long moments before he returns to his work.

Some players are constants; others are almost always absent. Tzuris represent a secret third thing, you suppose: there, but never seen. You've done the work by now, pushing the limits of your power, hugging its walls like you were trying to clip out of bounds - you've mapped the shape of "possible" in exhaustive detail - but it's beyond you. A body that hasn't yet entered the game won't respond to you, won't function as a vessel. So it may be that you will never meet again. No matter what you do, they only exist somewhen you can't go.

Tzuris never makes it.
